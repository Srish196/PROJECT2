            The ancient Indian kingdom of Chedi had its capital at Suktimati, which is located in Sagar in contemporary times. 
            The history of Sagar District before 1022 A.D. is generally unknown; after that, records are available. Sagar was under the rule of Ahir Rajas and their capital was at Garhpehra.
            In 1660, Udenshah, founded the present town of Sagar.
            after 1735, the city came under the rule of the Peshwas. 
            In 1818, a large part of the Sagar district was ceded by Peshwa Baji Rao II to the British East India Company. 
            Administratively, the position of Sagar and the neighbouring territories underwent frequent changes.
